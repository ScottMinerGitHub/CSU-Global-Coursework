121        The CPSFAMID represents a redefinition of MEPS families into
122        families defined by the Current Population Survey (CPS).
123        
124        Some of the distinctions between CPS-and MEPS-defined families are that MEPS
125        families include and CPS families do not include: non-married partners,
126        foster children, and in-laws. These persons are considered as members of separate
127        families for CPS-like families. CPS-like families are defined so a poverty status
128        classification variable consistent with established definitions of poverty can be
129        assigned to the CPS-like families and used for weight poststratification purposes.
130        
131        FAMWT15C can be used to make estimates for the cross-section of families in the
132        U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population on December 31, 2015
133        where families are identified based on the CPS definition of a family unit.
134        
135        The annualized family ID letter, FAMIDYR, identifies eligible members of the
136        eligible annualized families within a DU.
137        
138        FAMWT15F can be used to make estimates for the cross-section of families in
139        the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population on December 31, 2015
140        where families are identified based on the MEPS definition of a family unit.
141        
142        Each MEPS family unit is uniquely identified by the combination of the
143        variables DUID and FAMIDYR while each CPS family unit
144        is uniquely identified by the combination of the variables DUID and CPSFAMID.
